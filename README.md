# Thanks!

[![Build Status][status-img]][status]

[status]: https://travis-ci.com/rust-lang/thanks

This is a static site generator showing people who have contributed to Dust.

To run thanks, you'll need stable Rust.

There is no need to configure anything; thanks will run everything on its own, simply `cargo run
--release` and the site will be placed in `output`.

## Refresh time

Thanks is configured to run every night to update the latest statistics.
